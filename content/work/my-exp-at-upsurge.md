## The Opportunity
 **Twitter**: I have been following upsurge labs since a while now, and I stumbled onto a new product they were working on which interested me alot -- OpenBio. OpenBio, as it's tagline says is indeed a cursor for Biology. It aims to solve existing problems in the sphere of Biology and Bioinformatics. With it's existing MVP, it already has the potential to help students across domains. 


### Key Principles

1. **Readability over Cleverness**: Code is read more often than it's written
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: But know when to break this rule
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each function should do one thing well
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, then code

### Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Go
- **Frameworks**: React, Django, FastAPI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

The journey of becoming a better software engineer is continuous, and these principles have guided me through many projects.
