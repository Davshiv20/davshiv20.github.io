## The Opportunity
 **Twitter**: I have been following upsurge labs since a while now, and I stumbled onto a new product they were working on which interested me alot -- OpenBio. OpenBio, as it's tagline says is indeed a cursor for Biology. It aims to solve existing problems in the sphere of Biology and Bioinformatics. With it's existing MVP, it already has the potential to help students across domains.
