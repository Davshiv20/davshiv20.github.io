I am going to be posting my learnings from each chapter



### Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape

#### Overview

 - Before we start, I'd like to embarassingly mention that I have tried to start reading this book many times, however it is only today that I got the will, time and patience to officially start it. 
  This chapter gives a good, solid introduction to Machine Learning, but with no abstraction. The author plunges you into the world of Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, which thereby provokes me to continue reading.

#### Some facts from the Chapter
 - Without knocking around the bushes, the author provides many examples which establish how Machine Learning is all about building systems that can learn and create context from data. Learning is measured by the ratio of how the performance P increases, with some experience E, on some task T.
 - Author dives deep into the importance and requirements of ML, about how it is great for complex systems for which we have no algorithmic solution or for which the environment is dynamic or ever changing. Machine Learning is the peak of productization, one could say. To explain further, Machine Learning exists to replace long list of hand-tuned rules, it provides for an approach to improve itself and by doing so, it productizes itself.
 - Author provides detailed examples on the usecases of Machine Learning, from filtering mails to self governed gaming, there is a wide array of tasks that Machine Learning is implemented.
 - Supervised Learning (labelled data), Unsupervised Learning (unlabelled data), Semi-supervised Learning (Learning and then Labelling) is explained. Batch Learning system(non - incremental, offline learning) and Online Learning system(incremental) is introduced. 
 - Instance based learning where system learns training by heart and contrastingly, model based system is introduced where system learns by measuring similarities from new and old instances, and makes relevant predictions are introduced.
 - Machine Learning Life Cycle is explored and the challenges it encounters at every steps are also learned. How important it is to choose the relevant data, how important it is to balance the size of the dataset. Concepts such as Feature Extraction, dimensionality reduction are also mentioned in the context of improving datasets.
 - The concepts of Overfitting and Underfitting are encountered. Overfitting being an instance where a certain model or a function becomes too intricately aligned to a portion or set of a data source which thereby ends up capturing the noise and irrelevant details instead of general patterns. Underfitting being an instance where the model is too naive to capture the nuances of a dataset, leading to poor performance in both training and test data sets.
 - Some methods are described such as hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation and relevant model selection which provide for good machine learning practices.
 - The chapter ends up with the classic question of how to find the best model for a particular dataset which performs the best in a production or testing environment (data), and the answer of this is *ASSUMPTION* and ofcourse, a lot more techinical things that we will discuss in next chapters.

### My Thoughts

I really like how the author encourages active engagement and requires the reader to truly grapple with the technical concepts, rather than simply presenting everything in an overly simplified manner. I've only read one chapter so I can't say for sure but I can assume that this project provides a solid foundation to the rest of the book and the chapters ahead. It's fair to say that I am excited to dive in further and write better content on it as I proceed.
